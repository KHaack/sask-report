The higher-level task of our subgroup, is to create a platform for knowledge extraction. This platform should be a webbased application based on different knowledge extraction tools. It should cooperate with various DICE projects and should unify the access to them. We should be able to convert information datasets to a RDF knowledge graphs. This grpahs should be used from other subgroups and other tools of the DICE group.\\

Over both semesters, it was my job to lead the subgroup, assign tasks and provide assistance for all subgroups. Like most projects, this one is divided into three phases: define and document the requirements, the implementation and the integration. For me, the first semester began with the requirement engineering and the design of the entire software architecture. Before we could start the development process, all group members had to be brought to a stand first. For the first weeks, André and I made sure that all the members of the group mastered the necessary technologies. At the same time, it was my responsibility with André to create the basic architecture. After that my main task was limited to creating the UI and provide general support to all and especially for the weaker group members.
