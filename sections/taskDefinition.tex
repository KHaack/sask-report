The main goal of the subgroup Data Extraction, is to create a knowledge extraction platform. These should unify the access to different tools for extraction and converting of any dataset to RDF as knowledge graph format. In the next step the extracted knowledge should be reused from other tools of the DICE group.\\

The development process consists of three steps: requirement engineering, implementation and integration. My task for the first step is to create users-stories and use cases regarding to the previously epic decisions. Afterwards Kevin and me have to decide how the software architecture should looks like and which kind of technologies are suitable for the project. The software architecture and technology decisions include a research and familiarization phase.\\
My responsibility for the implementation phase is the backend and extractor part. 

Every task who is similar to the other team members
