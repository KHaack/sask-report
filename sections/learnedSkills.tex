During the project I have solidified my knowledge in many technologies, such as Docker, Maven, Travis CI, git, Hadoop, Bootstrap, JQuery and Spring-Boot with Eureka. I've improved my ability to lead a team and to teach other developer in basic development techniques. From a scientific point of view, I learned a lot about about named entity recognition and relation extraction.
