In order to be as flexible as possible in the future, we opted for a microservice architecture.

Microservices should provide unified access to the external projects.\\

\subsection{Repository}
Repo-ms simple interface to the Hadoop system\\

\subsection{Database}
The second persistent layer, next to Hadoop, is a Fuseki server. Apache Jena Fuseki is a SPARQL server, in our case its setup in a docker container. It uses a TDB and provides a REST interface for updating and query the database. This was the main task of Suganya and Sepide in the first semester. They implemented the database microservice as a facade. The provide a simplified access to the database and ensure that other systems are informed about changes centrally. I support the two in programming the microservice.

\subsection{Logging}
To implement a centralized logging solution we setup the ELK stack. Consist of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. All three are delivered in preconfigured docker containers. Elasticsearch is a search engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side pipeline that collects the log data from the sources and sends it to Elasticsearch. Kibana visualize the data from Elasticsearch. Each microservices writes its log into a special directory, from which Logstash retrieves the logs. This was the main task of Suganya and Sepide in the second semester and I supported them in the configuration of the docker containers and the implementation of the changes in the microservices.
