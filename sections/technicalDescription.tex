In order to be as flexible as possible in the future, we opted for a microservice architecture.

\subsection{Logging}
To implement a centralized logging solution we setup the ELK stack. Consist of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. All three are delivered in preconfigured docker containers. Elasticsearch is a search engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side pipeline that collects the log data from the sources and sends it to Elasticsearch. Kibana visualize the data from Elasticsearch. Each microservices writes its log into a special directory, from which Logstash retrieves the logs. This was the main task of Suganya and Sepide this semester and I supported them in the configuration of the docker containers and the implementation of the changes in the microservices.
