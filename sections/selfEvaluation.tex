Throughout the project, it has always been my job to help the weaker group members. Since the hardest parts of the development were completed after the first semester, I put in the second semester even more time in this support. Already in the first week it turned out that it was a good decision. The most of the weaker group members have learned something about software development and independent work. In my estimation, some group members were able to improve their way of working. I also think that working as a team leader has worked well in almost all cases. I was able to help all the group members who were looking for help and were motivated. By telephone, I was always available for the group members. So I was able to provide support even outside the meetings. In this way others in the group could work without interruption.\\
All in all, I think that under my leadership and with my help, some members have greatly improved their skills. And even the project had some good improvements in the last semester.
