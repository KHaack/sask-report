Short self-evaluation\\
I think one of my main task was the support of all team members. We were always a
contact persons for the other group members. In addition to the regular meetings, we held
additional meetings for our group members almost every week. We talked about problems
and started pair programming if necessary. Because my programming tasks will be less in
the next semester, I can concentrate even more on weaker team members. We want to
write more documentation and we tried to be a mentor for the new group members.
